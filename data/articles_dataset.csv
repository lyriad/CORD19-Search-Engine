Animals were exposed to aerosols of ovalbumin on day 3. Two weeks after ovalbumin sensitization, mice were challenged with oval- bumin aerosols; 24 hours later, airway responsiveness (AR) to inhaled methacholine, levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Results: Neither influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 nor H 3 N 2 ) alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone caused changes in AR or IgE. However, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with either influenza A virus increased AR and levels of ovalbumin-specif- ic IgE. On BALF-cell analysis, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A increased the number of lymphocytes but not the number of eosinophils. No difference in AR or IgE levels was observed between the 2 strains of influenza A viruses. Immmunostaining of BALF cells showed an increase in T cells, especially CD8 + cells, with ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A. Conclusion: Infection by influenza A virus enhances sensitiza- tion to inhaled antigens and airway responsiveness in mice by means of mechanisms including CD8 + cells and antigen-specif- ic IgE Abbreviations used BAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage BALF: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid FRC: Functional residual capacity H 1 N 1 : Influenza virus A/PR/8/34 H 3 N 2 : Influenza virus A/Guizhou-X PD 35 Mch: Cumulative dose of inhaled methacholine at which airway resistance increases by 35% PFU: Plaque-forming unit sRaw: Specific airway resistance sRaw L : sRaw of the lower airway"

M-mediated IFN-␤ induction was confirmed at the viral infection level since a point mutation at the V68 residue of M markedly inhibited SARS-CoV pseudovirally induced IFN-␤ production. Thus, the results in- dicate for the first time that SARS-CoV M protein may function as a cytosolic PAMP to stimulate IFN-␤ production by activating a TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascade"
